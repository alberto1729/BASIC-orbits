# BASIC-orbits
An orbit calculator using numerical integration to calculate the planet orbits using BASIC.

To execute this program a Basic compilator is needed like Qbasic. This will run in a DOS emulator like DOSBOX.

The speed of the program will be locked to the speed of the CPU so the animation will run faster with ALT-F12
and slower with CTRL-F12.
